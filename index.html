              Mathematics, Life orientation
              In school I was not one of the brightest students due to being really
              lazy and playful, I worried more about soccer, cricket, tennis in simple
              I’m a sport fanatic, but towards the end of my schooling life i'v
              became a little serious knowing my parents doesn’t have any
              business's for me so I must go and study. I worked little hard in
              matric and got the marks I needed for what I wanted to study in
              university .
              Matriculated in 2015 with a bachelor pass</p>

              I’ve found it really challenging especially with the different program

            <p class="educations-back-desc"  style="font-size: 1.5rem;">I started off as a cashier, I then stared helping with the daily
              cash ups and recons, after a few years I officially became the till
              manager. I initially started working part time during my school
              holidays like in November,December until school opened. Once
              school opened I was allowed to take a break and get ready for
              university but still worked part like on Fridays and Saturdays.
              During this time I learned a lot of stuff in the store and in
              November of 2017 I became the till manager for that period of
              November,December,January because the manager trusted me
              and my work ethic. Once January came every year I leave for
              university the manager takes over,
              The store is not so busy anymore due to the school rush being
              over and also the Christmas shopping.

              courses where by many campuses over the whole of
              South Africa tunes in to watch the live feed for their respective
              students of the lecturer which is presented by our university. I
              help set up the venue and also broadcast the live feed of the
              lecture to all other universities such as wits tucks etc.
              I also helped with the IT support group so basically we used to
              sort out computers in the lecture halls that were old and slow
              and small things such as if the computer sound isn't connecting
              etc
